    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The following is a recipe from Bon Appétit. The recipe is by Chris Morocco.  The photograph is by Alex Lau.</p>
    <p>I have made this recipe a few times, mostly for Thanksgiving.  I have found that this is the best way to make and enjoy Green Bean Casserole.  It always comes out super delicious!  I usually bake it for 30 minutes, wrop it and take it over to where we are getting together.  Then there I bake for another 20 minutes, add onions and bake for additional 5 minutes</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lb. green beans</li>
        <li>Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 lb. crimini mushrooms, sliced, divided</li>
        <li>6 Tbsp. unsalted butter, divided</li>
        <li>4 Large sprigs thyme</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, finely grated</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3/4 cup French's fried onions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375°.  Working in batches, cook green beans in a large pot of boiling salted water until bright green and halfway to tenderness, about 3 minutes per batch.  Drain and let cool; trim stem ends</li>
        <li>Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Cook half of mushrooms without stirring, until golden brown underneath, about 2 minutes.Toss and continue to cook, tossing occasionally, until browned on both sides, about 3 minutes more.  Add 2 Tbsp. butter and 2 thume sprigs to pan.  Cook, tossing occasionally, until butter browns and mushrooms are dark browna dn very tender, about 4 minutes longer.  Season with salt and transfer to a plate.  Repeat with 2 Tbsp. butter, salt and remaining oil, mushrooms and thyme.</li>
        <li>Melt remaining 2 Tbsp. butter in a large saucepan over medium-low heat.  Whisk in flour and cook, whisking occasionally, until roux is golden brown and smells mildly nutty, about 4 minutes.  Whisk in milk and cream.  Increase heat and bring to a simmer, whisking often and cook until béchamel sauce is thick and bubbling, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat and whisk in garlic and Parmesan; season with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li>Arrange green beans and mushrooms in a 2-qt. baking dish.  Pour sauce over (it may not look like enough, but it will get saucier as it bakes).  Cover tightly with foil and bake until sauce is bubbling, 25-30 minutes.  Uncover and continue to bake until casserole is lightly browned on top and around the edges, 15-20 minutes longer.  Top with fried onions and contunue to bake until onions are slightly darker and fragrant, about 3 minutes.  Let sit 10 minutes to set before serving.</li>
    </ol>
