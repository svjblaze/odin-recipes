    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The following is a recipe from Bon Appétit. The recipe is by Melissa Hamilton and Chrisopher Hirsheimer.  The photograph is by Hirsheimer Hamilton.</p>
    <p>I have made this recipe a few time, with a few tweaks and found it to be delicious!  I usually add mozzarella cheese to one side and omit the parsley all together.  </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup (1 Stick) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled, crushed</li>
        <li>Large handful of fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 baguette</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Finely grated Parmesan</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450°.  Heat butter and oil in a small saucepan over medium heat.  Add garlic and parsley and cook, stirring occasionally, until butter is completely melted.</li>
        <li>Slice bread in half lengthwise, then place on a baking sheet and brush cut sides with butter mixture.</li>
        <li>Slice crosswise 1" thick, without cutting all the way through; season with salt and top with Parmesan.  Bake until golden, 10-15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
