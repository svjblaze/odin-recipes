    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe for Cajun Shrimp was given to me by my father.  During his time in Lousiana, he experienced this dish and would make it for us growing up.  </p>
    <p>In our family we still make this dish during holiday get togethers.  As with many dishes, butter really helps to make this dish great.  Now as we are older,we tend to reduce the total amount of butter.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 lbs. Shrimp cleaned, skin on</li>
        <li>2-3 Medium Onions</li>
