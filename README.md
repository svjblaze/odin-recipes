Odin Project


The purpose of this repository is to learn proper use of github and html coding to create a basic website.  At the end of this journey I hope to be more comfortable with coding and using online tools.  I am following The Odin Project fundamentals course. I am currently using a M1 MacBook Air and VSCode.
